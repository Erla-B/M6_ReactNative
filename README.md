I really liked this project! 
I didn't want to continue with my previous projects because they gave me a lot of trouble so I found a tutorial on React Native to follow. The styles were all ready, I didn't make those, to be able to focus more on the actual code and I actually learned a lot! 
And for once the deployment didn't give me any trouble so you can enjoy the live link!
